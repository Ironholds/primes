Description: Functions for dealing with prime numbers, such as testing whether a
    number is prime and generating a sequence prime numbers. Additional functions
    include finding prime factors and Ruth-Aaron pairs, finding next and previous
    prime numbers in the series, finding or estimating the nth prime, estimating
    the number of primes less than or equal to an arbitrary number, computing
    primorials, and prime k-tuples (e.g., twin primes).
