\title{Find the Greatest Common Divisor, Least Common Multiple, or Coprimality}
\usage{
gcd(m, n)

lcm(m, n)

coprime(m, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{m, n}{integer vectors.}
}
\value{
A vector of the length of longest input vector. If one
vector is shorter, it will be recycled. The \code{gcd} and \code{lcm} functions
return an integer vector while \code{coprime} returns a logical vector.
}
\description{
These functions provide vectorized computations for the greatest common
divisor (\code{gcd}), least common multiple (\code{lcm}), and coprimality. Coprime
numbers are also called \emph{mutually prime} or \emph{relatively prime} numbers.
}
\details{
The greatest common divisor uses Euclid's algorithm, a fast and widely
used method. The least common multiple and coprimality are computed using
the gcd, where \eqn{lcm = \frac{a}{gcd(a, b)} \times b}{lcm = a / gcd(a, b) * b}
and two numbers are coprime when \eqn{gcd = 1}.
}
\examples{
gcd(c(18, 22, 49, 13), 42)
## [1] 6 2 7 1

lcm(60, 90)
## [1] 180

coprime(60, c(77, 90))
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
