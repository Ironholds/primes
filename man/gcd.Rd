\title{Find the Greatest Common Divisor, Least Common Multiple, or Coprimality}
\usage{
gcd(m, n)

lcm(m, n)

is_coprime(m, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{m, n}{integer vectors.}
}
\value{
A vector of the length of longest input vector. If one
vector is shorter, it will be recycled. The \code{gcd} and \code{lcm} functions
return an integer vector while \code{is_coprime} returns a logical vector.
}
\description{
These functions provide vectorized computations for the greatest common
divisor (\code{gcd}), least common multiple (\code{lcm}), and coprimality.
}
\details{
The greatest common divisor uses Euclid's algorithm, a fast and widely used
method. The least common multiple and coprimality are computed using the
GCD.
