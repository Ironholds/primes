\title{Generate and Test for Prime Numbers}
\usage{
generate_primes(max)

is_prime(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{max}{the maximum value to generate prime numbers up to.}

\item{x}{an integer vector containing elements you want to determine the primality of.}
}
\description{
generate prime numbers or test whether a sequence of numbers you have are
prime or not.
}
\details{
\code{is_prime} and \code{generate_primes} rely on Wilson's theorem to test for a number's primality;
as primality algorithms go, this is actually a very \emph{slow} approach - in theory. In practice, because of the
limits R institutes around integer sizes, it's fast enough for our needs. For example, 10m numbers, all 2^30-sized,
can be tested for primality using this package in 100ms.

\examples{
#Test for primality
is_prime(1299827)
# [1] TRUE

generate_primes(12)
# [1]  2  3  5  7 11
